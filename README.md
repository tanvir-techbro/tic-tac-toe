# Tic-Tac-Toe in C++

A simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++ while learning multi-file projects, functions, input validation, and basic game logic.

Players take turns entering numbers 1–9 to place their mark (X or O). First to get three in a row wins — or it's a draw!

## Features
- Input validation (only accepts valid moves 1–9)
- Clear win/draw detection
- Multi-file structure (main.cpp + logic.cpp + logic.h)

## How to Play

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanvir-techbro/tic-tac-toe.git
cd tic-tac-toe
```

### 2. Run it
```bash.
/game
```

Follow the on-screen prompts — enter numbers 1 to 9 to make your move.
Have fun! 🎮
